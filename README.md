# Mongez Create App

This project aims to quickly create a new project with Mongez tools.

## Install React Js App

To install a React Js Application with its recommended proper tools, run the following command:

`npx create-mongez-app react my-app`

> Please note this will create a new React Js project with Typescript.

## Create project with select style behavior

When you run the command, it will ask you what style type you prefer to use, you can choose from `scss` or `Styled Components` or select `both`.

You can also choose to select the defaults values by passing `--defaults` arguments or `-d` for shorthand

`npx create-mongez-app react my-app --defaults`
